Prototype version of AIRFLOW (CS:GO cheat). The reason why it was leaked because it's outdated now.
Also some old staff and haters thought that it was based on WEAVE.SU
But anyway there's a lot of some pasted code, except this features:

```
Animaton resolver (doesnt work now)
Rage aimbot & hitscan 
Anti aims
Visuals
World modulation (fog & bloom changes)
Nightmode
```
